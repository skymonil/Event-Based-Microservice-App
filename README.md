# 🧩 Event-Driven Microservices Platform (App Repository)

This repository contains the **core microservices application code** for an event-driven, cloud-native system built using:

* Node.js microservices
* Kafka (event streaming)
* PostgreSQL (transactional data)
* Redis (read projections)
* OpenTelemetry + Jaeger (distributed tracing)
* Saga pattern for distributed transactions
* Outbox pattern for reliable event publishing

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

This system follows **event-driven microservices architecture** with strong consistency using **Saga + Outbox pattern**.

### Core Services

| Service           | Responsibility               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| order-service     | Create & manage orders       |
| inventory-service | Stock reservation & release  |
| payment-service   | Payment processing & refunds |
| user-service      | User management              |
| redis-projection  | Real-time stock view         |

### Infrastructure

* Kafka → async communication
* PostgreSQL → transactional state
* Redis → fast read models
* Jaeger → distributed tracing
* Prometheus → metrics

## 🔄 Event Flow (Simplified)

```text
Client
  ↓
order-service
  → order.created
      ↓
inventory-service
        → inventory.reserved
            ↓
payment-service
                 → payment.completed / payment.failed
                        ↓
order-service (final state)
```

### If payment fails → inventory is released automatically (Saga compensation)

## 📊 Distributed Tracing

Every request is traced across:

* HTTP requests
* Kafka events
* Database calls
* Redis updates

Using:

* OpenTelemetry
* W3C Trace Context (traceparent)
* Jaeger UI

You can visually see:

```text
Order → Inventory → Payment → Compensation (if needed)
```

## 🚀 Running Locally (Docker)

### Prerequisites

* Docker
* Docker Compose

### Start everything:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start:

* Kafka + Zookeeper
* PostgreSQL
* Redis
* All microservices
* Jaeger

## 🔍 Access Services

| Tool      | URL                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Order API | [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)   |
| Jaeger UI | [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686) |
| Kafka     | localhost:9092                                   |
| Redis     | localhost:6379                                   |

---

## 🧪 Test Flow

Create an order:

```bash
POST /api/orders
```

Then observe:

✅ Inventory reservation
✅ Payment processing
✅ Traces in Jaeger
✅ Redis projection updates

---

## 🛡 Key Patterns Implemented

### ✔ Saga Pattern

* Ensures consistency across services
* Handles failures with compensation

### ✔ Outbox Pattern

* Guarantees event publishing with DB transactions
* No lost messages

### ✔ CQRS (partial)

* PostgreSQL → write model
* Redis → read model

### ✔ Distributed Tracing

* Kafka context propagation
* Full request lifecycle visibility
